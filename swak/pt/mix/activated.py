    """Combined stacked feature vectors through a single dense layer.

    Multiple feature vectors stacked in a single tensor are concatenated into a
    single, wide vector and projected down into a space the size of the model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mod_dim: int
        Size of the feature space. The input tensor is expected to be of that
        size in its last dimension and the output will again have this size in
        its last dimension.
    n_features: int
        The number of features to combine. Must be equal to the size of the
        next-to-last dimension of the input tensor.
    activate: Module or function, optional
        The activation function to be applied after linearly combining
        features. Must be a callable that accepts a tensor as sole
        argument, like a module from ``torch.nn`` or a function from
        `torch.nn.functional``, depending on whether it needs to be further
        parameterized or not. Defaults to ``identity``, resulting in no
        non-linear activation whatsoever.
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments are passed on to the linear layer.

        ----------
        inp: Tensor
            The size of the next-to-last last dimension of the input tensor is
            expected to match the `n_features` provided at instantiation.
            The last dimension (of size `mod_dim`) is expected to contain the

        Tensor
            The output tensor has one fewer dimensions than the input.
            The next-to-last dimension is dropped and the size of the last
            dimension is once again `mod_dim`.
