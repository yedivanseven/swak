class GatedResidualSumMixer(Module):
    """Combine stacked feature vectors by a per-instance linear combination.

    The per-instance coefficients sum to 1 for each data point and can thus be
    seen as some sort of per-instance feature importance. They are obtained by
    concatenating all features into a single, wide vector, and then passing it
    through a Gated Residual Network (GRN), [1]_ such that the size of the
    output equals the number of features to combine.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mod_dim: int
        Size of the feature space. The input tensor is expected to be of that
        size in its last dimension and the output will again have this size in
        its last dimension.
    n_features: int
        The number of features to combine. Must be equal to the size of the
        next-to-last dimension of the input tensor.
    activate: Module or function, optional
        The activation function to be applied after (linear) transformation,
        but prior to gating. Must be a callable that accepts a tensor as sole
        argument, like a module from ``torch.nn`` or a function from
        `torch.nn.functional``, depending on whether it needs to be further
        parameterized or not. Defaults to an ``ELU`` activation.
    gate: Module or function, optional
        The activation function to be applied to half of the (non-linearly)
        transformed input before multiplying with the other half. Must be
        a callable that accepts a tensor as sole argument, like a module from
        ``torch.nn`` or a function from ``torch.nn.functional``, depending
        on whether it needs to be further parameterized or not.
        Defaults to a sigmoid.
    drop: Module, optional
        Typically an instance of ``Dropout`` or ``AlphaDropout``. Defaults to
        ``Dropout(p=0.0)``, resulting in no dropout being applied.
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments to pass through to the linear layers.

    Note
    ----
    This implementation is inspired by how features are combined in `Temporal
    Fusion Transformers`, [1]_ but it is not quite the same. Firstly, the
    inputs are not the raw feature embeddings but the final feature embeddings
    to be linearly combined. Secondly, the intermediate linear layer (Eq. 3) is
    eliminated and dropout is applied directly to the activations after the
    first layer. Finally, the layer norm (Eq. 2) is omitted because normalizing
    right before passing through a softmax seems unnecessary.
