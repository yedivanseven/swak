    """Combine stacked feature vectors by a per-instance linear combination.

    The per-instance coefficients sum to 1 for each data point and can thus be
    seen as some sort of per-instance feature importance. They are obtained by
    concatenating all features into a single, wide vector, linearly projecting
    down to a vector with the same number of elements as there are features to
    combine, optionally activating, and then applying a softmax.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mod_dim: int
        Size of the feature space. The input tensor is expected to be of that
        size in its last dimension and the output will again have this size in
        its last dimension.
    n_features: int
        The number of features to combine. Must be equal to the size of the
        next-to-last dimension of the input tensor.
    activate: Module or function, optional
        The activation function to be applied after (linearly) mixing the
        concatenated features. Must be a callable that accepts a tensor as sole
        argument, like a module from ``torch.nn`` or a function from
        `torch.nn.functional``, depending on whether it needs to be further
        parameterized or not. Defaults to ``identity``, resulting in no
        non-linear activation whatsoever.
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments are passed on to the linear layer.

        Parameters
        ----------

        ----------
