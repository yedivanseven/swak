class GatedResidualConcatMixer(Module):
    """Combined stacked feature vectors through a Gated Residual Network (GRN).

    Parameters
    ----------
    mod_dim: int
        Size of the feature space. The input tensor is expected to be of that
        size in its last dimension and the output will again have this size in
        its last dimension.
    n_features: int
        The number of features to combine. Must be equal to the size of the
        next-to-last dimension of the input tensor.
    activate: Module or function, optional
        The activation function to be applied after (linear) transformation,
        but prior to gating. Must be a callable that accepts a tensor as sole
        argument, like a module from ``torch.nn`` or a function from
        `torch.nn.functional``, depending on whether it needs to be further
        parameterized or not. Defaults to an ``ELU`` activation.
    gate: Module or function, optional
        The activation function to be applied to half of the (non-linearly)
        transformed input before multiplying with the other half. Must be
        a callable that accepts a tensor as sole argument, like a module from
        ``torch.nn`` or a function from ``torch.nn.functional``, depending
        on whether it needs to be further parameterized or not.
        Defaults to a sigmoid.
    drop: Module, optional
        Typically an instance of ``Dropout`` or ``AlphaDropout``. Defaults to
        ``Dropout(p=0.0)``, resulting in no dropout being applied.
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments to pass through to the linear layers.

    Note
    ----
    This implementation is inspired by how features are encoded in `Temporal
    Fusion Transformers`, [1]_ but it is not quite the same. Specifically, the
    intermediate linear layer (Eq. 3) is eliminated and dropout is applied
    directly to the activations after the first layer. Also, the layer norm
    (Eq. 2) is replaced by simply dividing the sum of (linearly projected)
    input and gated signal by 2. Should additional normalization be desired,
    it can be performed independently on the output of this module.

        Parameters
        ----------
        inp: Tensor
            The size of the next-to-last last dimension of the input tensor is
            expected to match the `n_features` provided at instantiation.

        Tensor
            The output tensor has one fewer dimensions than the input.

            dimension is once again `mod_dim`.
