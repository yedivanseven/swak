    Parameters
    ----------

        Path (including file name) to the  model's ``state_dict()`` on disk.

    map_location: str or Device, optional
        The device to load the state onto. Defaults to ``None`` which loads
        to the PyTorch device(s) that were saved with the model.
    merge: bool, optional
        Whether the loaded state should be merged into the state of the model
        (``True``) or replace its state (``False``). Defaults to ``True``.
    not_found: str, optional
        What to do if the specified file is not found. One of "ignore",
        "warn", or "raise" (use the ``NotFound`` enum to avoid typos).

        file is not found, `merge` is overridden to ``True``, thus returning
